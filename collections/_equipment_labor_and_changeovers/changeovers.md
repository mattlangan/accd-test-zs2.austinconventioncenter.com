- Changeover/Re-set fees will be assessed when rooms are changed after the original set. Changes made to room set requirements withing five (5) days of the first contract date are subject to reset fees and labor charges. The standard rate will be applied for room changes.
- Changeover/Re-set fees and labor fees will also be assessed if the Austin Convention Center staff must re-set a previously set room due to AV or Deco interference. Please make all allowances for AV and Deco equipment five (5) days before the first contracted date with your Event Coordinator.
- Changeover/Re-set fees include any additional equipment brought into the room plus labor to reset the space. For example, if you change from rounds for 100 to theater for 200, you will be charged for the additional 100 chairs plus the labor.
