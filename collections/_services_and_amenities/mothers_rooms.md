Nursing mothers are given private, secure areas with comfortable furnishings including a changing station, sofa and cooler. The motherâ€™s room on our first level is located on the south side of the building and the second is located on the north side of the building on the third level (see map below for reference). In addition to these two rooms, we also have a portable nursing pod available upon request.
