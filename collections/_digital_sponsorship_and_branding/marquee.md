### Marquees Notes to Consider

- The LED exterior marquees have limited resolution capabilities, which are not suitable for every graphic display type.
- Keep in mind, the marquees are in sunlight and this can affect the legibility. White backgrounds are highly inadvisable.
- Highly detailed graphics with intricate shapes may lose shape/readability.
- Graphics must be submitted within exact pixel dimensions for each of the two (2) marquee dimension sizes.
- We cannot resize flattened (rasterized) graphics to fit without significant distortion and/or image loss.
