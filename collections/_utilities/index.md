We provide all utilities as an exclusive service including, but not limited to, electrical, water and drain, compressed air, telephone services and wired internet. We ask that clients make utility service order forms available to exhibitors at least sixty (60) days before the first contract date. Clients are responsible for utility services costs assessed at the prevailing rate.

- Permanent facility outlets are not considered part of an exhibitor’s booth space.
- Certain utilities may be limited to specific areas within the building. (i.e. power and water).
- Electrical equipment must be underwriter laboratory approved.
- Our electrical equipment (extension cords, distribution boxes, etc.) should not be removed by exhibitors, service contractors, or other personnel.
- The exhibit hall utility floor pockets are located on thirty-foot (30’) centers. Exhibit plan layouts should be designed accordingly. Exhibit floor plans not aligned on thirty-foot (30’) centers may be assessed additional charges and may not be accessible for utility services to booths. Some utility services may not be accessible for booths.
- An exhibitor list, both in alphabetical and numerical order, is required so prompt service may be provided to exhibitors. Services ordered and not used are not credited or refunded.
- Unscheduled labor may be subject to the overtime charges of one and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate.
- Electrical outlets and audio patches are included for client use only with the use of our preferred AV company only (Freeman).
- Over payment for utility services is only considered when our personnel is notified  before the end of the event at which over payment was made.
- Production requirements must be submitted forty- five (45) days in advance. For a complete listing and additional information on utility services and technical services, refer to the following order forms.
