### Tables for catering

The ACC provides tables for all catered functions at no charge to the Licensee.   Linens are provided by ACC Catering based on rounds of 10.  Additional fees will apply for linens to cover additional tables.

### Catering Changeovers

Changeovers to catering functions are not subject to labor or re-set fees. Labor fees are waived for rooms being changed to a catering function. Please note that labor/changeover fees will be assessed for rooms being changed from catered to non-catered function. For example, moving from banquet lunch to theater without catering.

### Set Up Time

Outside of "working" meals and all day catering refreshes, ACC Catering does request a 2 hour set up window for large catered events.  If the set up time is less than 2 hours, please discuss with your catering representative.  Additional labor fees may apply.
