In addition to the two permanent cafes, Portable Concession and bar areas are available. Please contact your catering manager for location options and power requirements.  

### Concession Space Requirements

ACC Catering requires a thirty by thirty foot (30’ x 30’) concession area to service five hundred (500) attendees if no other food options are available, and a thirty -foot by sixty- foot (30’x 60’) area is required to service one thousand plus (1000+) attendees. This space is for the equipment only; additional space is needed for seating and queue lines. Exhibit floor plans must indicate the thirty by thirty foot (30’ x 30’) areas for concession equipment in each hall. ACC permanent concession locations may not be blocked at any time.
