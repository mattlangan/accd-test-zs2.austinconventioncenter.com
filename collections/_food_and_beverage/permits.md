A food permit from the City of Austin Health Department is required to be obtained and displayed in each location providing food and beverage samples.  Exhibitors must comply with all rules and regulations outlined by the permit. The Client/Show Manager is responsible for obtaining all health permits a minimum of 10 business days prior to arrival.  Client/Show Manager is strongly encouraged to reach out to the City of Austin Public Health to develop a partnership that results in open, two-way communication throughout the pre-planning process.
